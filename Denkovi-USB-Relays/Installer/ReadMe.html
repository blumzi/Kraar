    <h2>Abstract.</h2>
    <p> This is an ASCOM Dome driver for the 8 relays USB switch by Denkovi, at the Kraar Observatory.</p>

    <h2>Hardware</h2>
    A board with 8 solid state relays, with USB interface, by Denkovi.

    <h2>Software</h2>
    <p>The driver supports a single USB-attached card.  The FTDI Id of the card can be set in the driver's Setup window.  It defaults to zero.</p>
    <p>A set of eight labels can be entered via the Setup window</p>

    <h2>Relays state persistance</h2>
    <p>The Setup window has a checkbox for relay value persistence.  If it is checked (default):</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Every five seconds the driver queries the card for the relays state. If a valid value is received, the driver saves it in the ASCOM profile.  This ensures that relay state changes performed through other interfaces will be preserved as well.</li>
        <li>If a valid state is saved in the ASCOM profile, the driver enforces it onto the card at Connect time</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If the checkbox is not checked, no relay state persistance will be maintained.</p>

    <h3>ASCOM Compliance</h3>
    <p>The driver passes the ASCOM 6.2 Compliance test.</p>
